### How to build

I already create a script command in txt, that you can copy and build by yourself,

Don't forget run ```python -m venv env```, to create a virtual environment,

after that run ```& env/Scripts/Activate.ps1``` (for Windows),

then run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all libraries, that's all, cheers!
